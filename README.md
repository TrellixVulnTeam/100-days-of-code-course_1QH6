# 100-days-of-code
This course aims at improving programming skills and mastering Python by building 100 projects in 100 days. The projects cut across data science, automation, web development, games and apps! The principles covered each day are more challenging than the ones before.The progression is from beginner to intermediate to advanced.The days 1 through 14 can be categorized as beginning projects, 15 through 57 as intermediate projects, and 58 through 80 as advanced projects.
Projects from days 81 to 100 would contribute to the development of your portfolio.Regardless of your Python skill level, you are at the proper place.
These projects are good for you.

## Steps To Follow

- **Star** this repository.
- On the [100-days-of-code-course](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course) repo page, click the **Fork** button.
    <br><img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-28613/images/help/repository/fork_button.png" title="Fork image" width="400"/>
- **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.
    <br><img src="https://docs.github.com/assets/images/help/repository/code-button.png" title="Code button" width="400"/>

    For example, run this command inside your terminal:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username>/100-days-of-code-course.git
    ```

    **Replace \<your-github-username\> with your specific GitHub username!**

    Learn more about [forking](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) and [cloning a repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
- Before you make any changes, [keep your fork in sync](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-sync-your-fork-with-the-original-git-repository/) to avoid any merge conflicts:

    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    ```
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.

- If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by [opensource.com](https://opensource.com/article/20/4/git-merge-conflict).

- Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` ([write a good commit message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), if possible):

    ```bash
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    ```

- Push the code _to your repository_.

    ```bash
    git push origin <branch-name>
    ```
