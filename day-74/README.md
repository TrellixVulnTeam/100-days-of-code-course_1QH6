# Combine Google Trends with other Time Series Data
In this script,we'll investigate:
- How search volume for "Bitcoin" relates to the price of Bitcoin
- How search volume for a hot stock like Telsa relates to that stock's price and
- How searches for "Unemployment Benefits" vary with the actual unemployment rate in the United States

You'll need to make time-series data comparable by resampling and converting to the same periodicity (e.g from daily data to monthly data),fine-tune
the styling of Matplotlib charts by using limits, labels, linestyles, markers, colours, and the chart's resolution,use grids to help visually 
identify seasonality in a time series,find the number of missing and NaN values and to locate NaN values in a DataFrame,work with Locators 
to better style the time axis on a chart and probably review the learning points from previous (3) days and apply them.


## Requirements 
  - You'll find the Python notebook format better suited when exploring and visualising a dataset,[Here's](https://colab.research.google.com) to 
  google Colab Notebook(You'd have to open the [starting project](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course/blob/main/day-74/Google%20Trends%20and%20Data%20Visualisation%20(start).ipynb) 
  of this day as a Google Colaboratory  notebook,then upload the other data files [needed](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course/blob/main/day-74/Google%20Trends%20and%20Data%20Visualisation%20(start).ipynb) in the notebook,) 
  or if you run locally on your computer, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and use the bundled Jypyter Notebook instead.
  - Install requirements pip install -r requirements.txt (if you are working locally)
  
  
  ## How to run script(if you are working locally)
  - Navigate to project and day's directory
  - ` python google_trends_and_data_visualisation.py`

  ### Additionally:
