#  Analyses of Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major

  PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree.In this script,Pandas is used to analyse data and produce answers
  to some questions.For example:
  - Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 
  - Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?
  - Which degrees have the highest earning potential?
  - What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?
  - Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average?
