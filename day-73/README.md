# Learn to Aggregate and Merge Data in Pandas while Analysing a Dataset of LEGO Pieces

The use of pandas will help answer questions about the history of the company, their product offering, and which LEGO set rules them all
For example

- What is the most enormous LEGO set ever created and how many parts did it have?
- In which year were the first LEGO sets released and how many sets did the company sell when it first launched?
- Which LEGO theme has the most sets? 
- When did the LEGO company really take-off based on its product offering? How many themes and sets did it release every year?
- Did LEGO sets grow in size and complexity over time? Do older LEGO sets tend to have more or fewer parts than newer sets? 
You'll combine a Notebook with HTML Markup,apply Python List slicing techniques to Pandas DataFrames,aggregate data using 
the .agg() function,create scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts with two axes in Matplotlib,understand database schemas that are 
organised by primary and foreign keys,merge DataFrames that share a common key and so on.

## Requirements 
  - You'll find the Python notebook format better suited when exploring and visualising a dataset,[Here's](https://colab.research.google.com) to 
  google Colab Notebook(You'd have to open the [starting project](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course/blob/main/day-73/Lego_Analysis_for_Course_(start).ipynb) of this day as a Google Colaboratory  notebook,then upload the [data](https://github.com/ima-eky/100-days-of-code-course/tree/main/day-73/data) folder in the notebook,) 
  or if you run locally on your computer, you can install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) and use the bundled Jypyter Notebook instead.
  
  
  ## How to run script(if you are working locally)
  - Navigate to project and day's directory
  - ` python main.py`
