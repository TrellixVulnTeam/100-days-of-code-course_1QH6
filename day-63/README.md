This is good for you if you ever wanted to keep track of the books you/others have read and give each book a rating.
- You'll need to create an SQLite database(using SQLAlchemy),then create, read, update and delete data in the database.Then,connect your database with a Flask application
 to serve data whenever needed
- SQLAlchemy is defined as an ORM Object Relational Mapping library. This means that it's able to map the relationships in the database into Objects.
- Tables can be defined as separate Classes and each row of data is a new Object.[Here's](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/quickstart/#a-minimal-application) more documentation on SQLAchemy
